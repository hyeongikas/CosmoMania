## Installation
### From Packages

For those that do not wish to compile the game on their own and use a binary right away, be aware of the following issues:

* Windows users are expected to have installed the [Microsoft Visual C++ x86 Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) prior to running the game. For those on a 64-bit operating system, grab the x64 redistributable as well. [DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) is also required. Windows 7 is the minimum supported version.
* Mac OS X users need to have Mac OS X 10.6.8 or higher to run StepMania.
* Linux users should receive all they need from the package manager of their choice.

### From Source

StepMania can be compiled using [CMake](https://cmake.org/). More information about using CMake can be found in both the `Build` directory and CMake's documentation.

### Submodules ###

This repository now uses submodules to attempt to keep the repository size down. Utilize `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to get the necessary submodules.
